## Comprehensive API Documentation using Swagger

The API documentation provides detailed information about the endpoints, request parameters, and responses. It is generated using Swagger, which allows for easy exploration and testing of the API.

### How to Use Swagger
1. **Access the Swagger UI**: Navigate to the `/api-docs` endpoint of your deployed application to access the Swagger UI.
2. **Explore Endpoints**: Browse through the list of available endpoints. Each endpoint is documented with its request method, URL, parameters, and responses.
3. **Try Out Endpoints**: Use the "Try it out" feature to test the endpoints directly from the Swagger UI. Enter the required parameters and execute the request to see the response.
4. **View Responses**: Check the response section to see the status code, response body, and headers for each request.

### Benefits of Using Swagger
- **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger provides an interactive interface for exploring and testing API endpoints.
- **Standardized Format**: The documentation follows the OpenAPI Specification, ensuring consistency and compatibility.
- **Ease of Use**: Developers can easily understand and use the API without needing to refer to external documentation.
